Devbot is an IRC bot using the Cinch framework.

Currently it sports the following features:
	- Dynamically reloadable plugins
	- Reporting git updates through webhooks
	- Reporting trello updates (through mechanize)

Btw, the git webhook is a security vulnerability for your bot if you don't firewall it.
